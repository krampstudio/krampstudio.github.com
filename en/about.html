You may notice I&#39;m not english native. Help me to fix my english by contributing to this <a href="https://github.com/krampstudio/krampstudio.github.com/blob/new/src/about-en.md">post</a>.

<p>Just a small blog based on <a href="http://github.com/krampstudio/staticatr">Staticatr</a>, hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github-Pages</a>, written with <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, and a product of thinkings and experiences about the web, open-source, development, technical watch and all those abstracts stuffs that make the life funiest.</p>
<p>In this blog, I&#39;m talking about my favorite topics and I won&#39;t be objective at all. I&#39;ll trash, as well, Mxcrxsxft because  of all the bad experiences I had with their OS (that is not really made for developers) or Xrxcle (for them it&#39;s not really subjective, please try to install a 10g on a CentOS 64bits before). I&#39;ll highlight all free or open-source projects (except Open/Libre Office, don&#39;t exagerate) or JavaScipt (because it rocks, this is fashion).</p>
