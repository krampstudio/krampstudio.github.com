`[post translated - needs review]`
You may notice I'm not english native. Help me to fix my english by contributing to this [post](https://github.com/krampstudio/krampstudio.github.com/blob/new/src/about-en.md).

Just a small blog based on [Staticatr](http://github.com/krampstudio/staticatr), hosted on [Github-Pages](http://pages.github.com/), written with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), and a product of thinkings and experiences about the web, open-source, development, technical watch and all those abstracts stuffs that make the life funiest.

In this blog, I'm talking about my favorite topics and I won't be objective at all. I'll trash, as well, Mxcrxsxft because  of all the bad experiences I had with their OS (that is not really made for developers) or Xrxcle (for them it's not really subjective, please try to install a 10g on a CentOS 64bits before). I'll highlight all free or open-source projects (except Open/Libre Office, don't exagerate) or JavaScipt (because it rocks, this is fashion).
